        <h3>Cars</h3>

      <div class="description">
        <p>While I don't really show my liking for cars, I enjoy working on them and can make
        my way around an engine. It spreads to more than just cars pretty much anything
      that resembles a car such as go-carts to atv's. How many people have raced a lawn mower?</p>

    <div class="even">
      <div class="description">
        <p>Everything from small pens on a lathe to making a rolling bench for a
        CNC router.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <p>The fact that I can turn an idea into a model on a computer, then
        have a machine make that idea for me is amazing. Once I made a Tesla
      turbine that spun to over 20,000 RPM.</p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>Just like most people nowadays I enjoy gaming. It allows you to relax after work,
          do things you can't do in real life, or just play with some friends</p>

        <p>I enjoy making websites. However I try to make them stand out from the
        rest. The majority of websites just seem bland. I'm not sure if it's just a
      minimilisitc thing but the aestheticc of 80's and 90's websites are way better.
     They seem to be more alive than the designs we have now.</p>
